Notes :






PLEASE RETURNTHIS FORMTOTHE STUDENT APPLICANT
Please note that the medical examination form presents a choice under IMPRESSION. We can only accept unconditional approval as stated
for student applicants desiring to begin or continue training. If you conclude that diving is not in the individual’s best interest or that their medi-

cal condition is likely to present a probable direct threat to others, please discuss your opinion with the person and check disapproval.
IMPRESSION:
             ___ APPROVAL (I find no medical conditions I consider incompatible with diving.)

             ___ DISAPPROVAL ( This applicant has medical conditions which in my opinion
                 clearly would constitute unacceptable hazards to health and safety in diving.)

                           MEDICAL EXCUSE REQUEST

Your medical provider should explain your medical condition using t his form or in a letter. The statemen t
must include WHY you need to be excused, the DAYS/DATES you need to be excused and WHEN YOU
MAY BE ABLE TO SERVE in the future.


Please do not ask court staff to contact your medical provider. It is the juror =s responsibility to provide the
required documentation. Any request that cannot be easily read will automatically be denied.

Attention Medical Provider. Using the medical statement section of this form or in a separate letter, please
briefly state the health or medical condition(s) the patient listed at the top of this form has that you feel will
prevent he or she from serving as a federal juror. You do not have to provide personal information on the

specific medical condition. If the individual is gainfully employed outside their residence, please indicate
why serving on a jury would be more difficult than the requirements of their employment. If the medical
condition is temporary, please indicate such, as well as when he or she will be able to serve in the future. If
the medical or health condition is chronic and the individual should be permanently excused, please indicate
this. The information you provide must be based on your knowledge of this individual=s health and medical
condition. Do not indicate that the patient merely feels he or she should be excused as this is incomplete
information which will automatically invalidate the request and the request will be considered denied.

Please print and sign your name and the name of the medical office you are affiliated with. Thank you.

Please do not ask court staff to contact your medical provider. It is the juror=s responsibility to obtain the

required information.

e the

e is requested
     has already been rendered, (3) the medical care requested is not cover

he Board. Pursuant to 22NYCRR§325-1.4(b) this authorization is limi

     Chair. A substantially similar variance request may not be submitted unl
ess the carrier has denied a previous request. Substantially similar req
uests that

MG-2.0 (12-14)                          TO THE CARRIER/EMPLOYER/SELF-INSURED EMPLOYER/SPECIAL FUND

Response Time and Notification Required:
The carrier/employer/self-insured employer/Special Fund must approve or 
grant each variance request in writing by completing this form
and sending it by fax or email to the Treating Medical Provider, claiman
t's legal counsel, if any, any parties of interest, and the Workers'
Compensation Board. The carrier/ employer/self-insured employer/Special Fund may respond orally to the Tr
eating Medical Provider about

the variance requested by such provider. If the insurance carrier or Special Fund responds orally, it still must send a 
written response
within the appropriate time period. If the carrier submits a notice of a
n IME or Medical Records Review within 5 business days of the
variance request, the carrier has 30 calendar days to get the IME exam o
r Medical Records Review and submit Form IME-4. If no notice of
an IME or Medical Record Review is submitted, the carrier has 15 calenda
r days from the date of the request to reply  to the variance
request.


Denial of the Variance Request:
For a denial of a variance request for medical treatment, the carrier/em
ployer/self-insured employer/Special Fund must explain why it was
denied and attach the written report of the medical professional--a phys
ician, registeredphysician assistant, registered professional nurse,
or nurse practitioner licensed by New York State, or the appropriate sta
te where the professionalpractices, who is employed by an
insurance carrier or Special Fund, or has been directly retained by the 
insurance carrier or Special Fund or is employed bya URAC

accredited company retained by the insurance carrier or Special Fund thr
ough a contract to review claims and advise the insurance carrier
or Special Fund--that reviewed the variance request. Such report shall inc
lude a list describing the medical records reviewed by the
medical professional when considering the variance request. The carrier
 has the option to submit citations or copies of relevant literature
published in recognized, peer-reviewed medical journals in support of a 
denial of a variance request. A medical report supporting the denial
of the variance request is not necessary when the denial is based upon t
he allegation that (1) the provider did not meet the burden of proof

that a variance is appropriate, (2) the medical care for which the var
iance is requested has already been rendered, (3) the medical care
requested is not covered under Section 13(a) of the Workers' Compensat
ion Law, (4) the claimant did not appear for a scheduled
independent medical examination, or (5) a new variance request was sub
mitted prior to a substantially similar request being granted or
denied or a substantially similar variance request has been denied, and 
the resubmitted request does not contain any additional
documentation or justification.


Controverted Claims:
If the compensation case is controverted, the carrier/self-insured emplo
yer/employer/Special Fund must still respond to the variance
request timely and in the same manner as requests in non-controverted cl
aims. If the carrier/employer/self-insured employer/Special Fund
approves a variance request when a claim is controverted or the compensa
bility of the body part is controverted, the approval only relates
to medical necessity and shall not be construed as an admission that the condition 
for which variance is requested is compensable. The

carrier/employer/self-insured employer/Special Fund shall not be respons
ible for the payment of medical care which is the subject of the
variance request until the question of compensability is resolved.

Failure to Timely Respond to Variance Report:
A valid variance may be deemed approved by an Order of the Chair issued 
by the Workers' Compensation Board if the carrier/employer/

self-insured employer/Special Fund fails to respond to a properly completed request within the time frames 
specified abov.eThe
Order of the Chair is the final decision of the Board.

The UIL Anabolic Steroid List is composed of substances that the Legislature has determined are
illgal. The UIL Anabolic Steroid List may be found online at:

               http://www.uiltexas.org/health/info/uil-anabolic-steroid-list
Testing protocol and procedures relating to medical exceptions may be found online at:
               http://www.uiltexas.org/files/health/steroid-protocol.pdf
In accordance with state law, the UIL recognizes that some anabolic steroids are dispensed,

prescribed, delivered, and administered by a licensed practitioner for a valid medical purpose in
the course of professional practice.   The UIL allows exceptions to be made for those student-
athletes with a documented medical history, as defined in the UIL Anabolic Steroid Testing

Program Protocol, demonstrating need for use of an anabolic   steroid.

Procedures for Request for Medical Exception


(A) A Student-athlete or his/her Parent may request a medical exception prior to being selected
for anabolic steroid testing by (1) providing Drug Free Sport with the Request For Medical
Exception Form, and (2) requesting the student-athlete’s physician to provide a documented

medical history of the need for the use of an anabolic steroid to Drug Free Sport.              The
documented medical history is to be sent directly from the physician to Drug Free Sport. Upon
receipt, Drug Free Sport will forward the student-athlete’s Request For Medical Exception Form

and the documented medical history from the student-athlete’s physician to the Drug Free Sport
approved Medical Review Officer for   review.

(B) A student-athlete or his/her parent may also request a medical exception within 48 hours (2

business days) of the first notification of a positive test result for Specimen A by (1) providing the
Medical Review Officer with the Request For Medical Exception Form, and (2) requesting the
student-athlete’s physician to provide a documented medical history of the need for the use of an

anabolic steroid to the Medical Review Officer.         A student-athlete’s Request For Medical
Exception Form and documented medical history must be received by the Medical Review
Officer within 48 hours (2 business days) after the first notification or it will not be reviewed.


Only a Drug Free Sport-approved Medical Review Officer may grant a medical exception. The
decision of the Medical Review Officer is final and is not subject to appeal.


Please submit the completed Request for Medical Exception Form to the National Center For
Drug Free Sport in (A) and the Medical Review Officer in (B) and any authorizations for the
release of medical records to the relevant licensed practitioner. Keep a copy for your records.

                                             Patient:

  1. ALWAYS KEEP THIS FORM WITH YOU. You may want to fold it and keep it in your wallet along

     with your driver’s license. Then it will be available in case of an emergency.
  2. Write down all of the medicines you are taking and list all of your allergies.

  3. Take this form to ALL doctor visits, when you go for tests and ALL hospital visits.

  4. WRITE DOWN ALL CHANGES MADE TO YOUR MEDICINES on this form. If you stop taking a
     certain medicine, draw a line through it and write the date it was stopped. If help is needed, ask
     your Doctor, Nurse, Pharmacist, or family member to help you to keep it up-to-date.

  5. In the NOTES column, write down the name of the doctor who told you to t
ake the medicine(s). You
     may also write down why you are taking the medicine (Examples: high blood pressure, high blood
     sugar, high cholesterol).

  6. When you are discharged from the hospital, someone will talk with you about WHICH MEDICINES
     TO TAKE AND WHICH MEDICINES TO STOP TAKING. Since many changes are often made
     after a hospital stay, a new form should be filled out. When you return to your doctor, take your new

     form with you. This will keep everyone up-to-date on your medicines.


                        HOW DOES THIS FORM HELP YOU?

  1. This form helps you and your family members remember all of the medicines you are taking.

  2. Provides your doctor(s) and others with a current list of ALL of your medicines. Doctors need to
     know the herbals, vitamins, and over-the-counter medicines you take!
  3. Helps you—concerns may be found and prevented by knowing what medicines you are taking.

                         Must be on the physician/providers letterhead

Please use the following guidelines when submitting a letter of medical necessity:


•   The diagnosis must be specific. For example, a diagnosis of “fatigue, bone pain or weakness” is not specific – a diagnosis
    of “Osteoporosis” is specific.

•   The recommended treatment must be named and described in detail by a licensed health care provider. A recommended
    treatment described, as “quitti ng smoking, healthier diet and regular or daily exercise recommended” does not provide
    enough information. Your provider must s pecifically name and describe the rec ommended treatment. An acce ptable
    description of treatment would be “I recommend 800 IU of Vitamin D and 1200 mg of Calcium supplements each day for
    the next 6 months to slow down the patient’s Osteoporosis progression.”

•   Your provider must state a specific length of treatment. Lifetime or indefinite lengths of treatment will not be approved.

or authorized to participate in any sport or other activity does not mean and is not to be interpreted as the opinion of the doctor or nurse that
the person examined is healthy, in need of no care, or can participate in any sport or other activity without serious medical risks. Any claim against

the doctor, nurse or other person involved in the examination will be submitted to binding arbitration pursuant to the rules and procedures of the
American Arbitration Association. The person examined and any person who signs on his or her behalf promises to indemnify the doctor or nurse
from any and all damages, claims, or losses, including injury or death that allegedly arise out of or are in any way related to the examination.

Participation: I hereby give my permission for the participant named above to participate in any Special Olympics activity or event of any kind. I
understand that participation at local or area competition does not guarantee advancement to State or World Games. Athletes must be registered

using this release form prior to any athlete training.

Medical: I represent and warrant to you that the athlete is physically and mentally able to participate in Special Olympics Texas.

Disclaimer: On behalf of the athlete and myself, I acknowledge that the athlete will be using facilities at his/her own risk and I, on my own behalf,

hereby release the physicians, organizers, officers, directors, agents or employees of Special Olympics Texas from any claim for damage or suit by
reason of any injury, illness, or damage whatsoever to person or property of myself or the athlete.

Hospitalization: If I am not personally present at the event in which the athlete is to compete so as to be consulted in case of emergency, you are
authorized on my behalf and at my account to take such measure and arrange for such medical and hospital treatment as yo▯u may deem advisable for
the health and well-being of the athlete.


Media: In permitting the athlete to participate, I am specifically granting permission to you to use the name, likeness, voice, words, and biographical
information of the athlete in television, radio, films, newspapers, magazines, web pages and other medi▯a, and in any form not heretofore described
for the purpose of advertising or communicating the purposes and activities of Special Olympics Texas and in appealing for funds to support such
activities.

Medical Authorization and Insurance Coverage
THIS HEALTH INFORMATION IS CORRECT, as far as I know. In the event the emergency contact cannot be reached in an emergency during the
program dates noted on this form, I HEREBY GIVE PERMISSION to the physician selected by The Oaks, to hospitalize, to secure proper treatment, to
order injection, anesthesia, dental care, and/or surgery for the applicant. I GIVE PERMISSION for The Oaks to provide for the applicant a certified First
Aid provider to administer First Aid and over the counter medication as needed for illness or injury as well as any medication noted. I AGREE that
photocopies or faxes of this complete form are to be considered legally valid and binding for trips off the camp property. I AGREE to obtain and maintain

personal insurance covering the applicant in the program with an appropriate wavier of subrogation rights to reflect the fact that the applicant's personal
insurance shall supersede and be used before any insurance coverage that may be provided by World Impact, Inc. In the absence of the
aforementioned insurance, I AGREE to pay all costs of rescue and/or medical services as may be incurred by the applicant.

Acknowledgment of Risks and Capabilities
I RECOGNIZE that there is a significant element of risk in any sport or activity associated with the outdoors and trust. THESE RISKS MAY INCLUDE but
are not limited to falling trees, rocks or other objects, poisonous plants, reptiles and insects, domesticated and wild animals, crossing steep, uneven and
loose terrain, exposure to the elements, lightning strikes, fires, stream crossings, open untreated water, flash floods, landslides, depending on other
group members for physical and emotional safety, contact with abrasive or slippery rock, equipment failure or misuse, injury from entanglement with
ropes, cables and other equipment, and at times a remote location far from modern medical facilities and rescue assistance. I AM AWARE that certain
portions of the program are physically demanding and that the applicant may be asked to walk, run, stretch, climb, push, pull, and perform rigorous and
potentially risky or dangerous physical activities which may double their normal resting heart rate. I VOLUNTARILY AGREE to participate in the
program. I realize that pre-existing medical conditions could affect the applicant's ability to participate in the program, I FURTHER AGREE to get a

qualified medical opinion if the applicant is over 50 years old and/or if I doubt their ability to participate in any given activity. I AGREE to abide by the
activity restrictions and to participate only to the extent that my medical, physical, emotional, or other conditions create no undue risk to myself, other
participants, or program staff. I FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE that exposure to these inherent risks, rigors and dangers may result in but is not limited to
separation from the group, bruising, bodily injury, emotional trauma, permanent disability including loss of sight and in extreme cases death. Knowing
these risks and potential consequences, I CERTIFY that the applicant is fully capable of participating in the program activities which may include but are
not limited to hiking, backpacking, bouldering, rock climbing, rappelling, initiative games, low ropes, high ropes, caving, mountain biking, paintball,
horseback riding, fishing, swimming, water sports, canoeing, sailing, powered water craft, white water rafting, archery, batting cage use, individual sports
including skateboarding, and team sports, except as noted under activity restrictions.

Assumption of Responsibility
I AGREE to assume full responsibility for the applicant's actions and their consequences during their participation in the program, and including without
limitation, any injury to the applicant and/or property or any inconvenience resulting there from any other circumstance related to such actions. I, the
applicant, AGREE to follow the camp rules as recorded in the Guest Group Handbook and communicated to me verbally by The Oaks staff.


Covenant of Good Faith
I AGREE that The Oaks has the right to refuse any applicant it judges to be incapable of meeting the rigors and requirements of participating in these
activities. I AGREE that any decision made by the staff of The Oaks will be binding upon the applicant. The Oaks reserves the right to dismiss any
applicant (at their own expense) who through their action or in-action, influences or causes an event which is detrimental to the best interests of
themselves or others.

Permission for Participation, Transportation, and Promotion
I GRANT PERMISSION for the applicant to engage in all The Oaks camp activities and to be transported by a World Impact, Inc. staff member who is a
legally licensed driver on all activities sponsored by The Oaks, on and off the camp property for the duration of the camping session. I AUTHORIZE use

of photos or video taken of the applicant at camp, quotations from evaluations, letters or interviews relating to the program experience for promotion and
commercial purposes.

Waiver of Liability
I HEREBY RELEASE and agree to INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS World Impact, Inc. its board of directors, officers, directors,
employees, guides, agents and volunteers and each and every land owner, municipality and/or governmental agency upon whose property the activity is
conducted, from any and all liability, claims, losses, costs, expenses (including without limitation, attorney fees) or demands (except those arising from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the aforementioned parties) that I, my heirs, executors, trustees, administrators, assignees, distributees,
personal or legal representatives and all members of my family, may now have or in the future make against such parties as a result of or related to any
injury, loss, death or damage of any kind whatsoever resulting from the applicant's participation in this program or from any driving mishap that may
occur during transportation.


Acceptance Signature
I/WE HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND ACCEPTED the terms and conditions stated herein and acknowledge that this agreement shall be effective
and binding upon the applicant hereafter.

171___OON_assignment_benefits_form.pdf,"           New York State Out-of-Network Surprise Medical Bill Assignment of Benefits Form

Use this form if you receive a surprise bill for health care services and want the services to be treated as in-
network. To use this form, you must: (1) fill it out and sign it; (2) send a copy to your health care provider
(include a copy of the bill or bills); and (3) send a copy to your insurer (include a copy of the bill or bills). If you

don’t know if it is a surprise bill, contact the Department of Financial Services at 1-800-342-3736.

A surprise bill is when:
1. You received services from a non-participating physician at a participating hospital or ambulatory surgical
center, where a participating physician was not available; or a non-participating physician provided services

without your knowledge; or unforeseen medical circumstances arose at the time the services were provided. You
did not choose to receive services from a non-participating physician instead of from an available participating
physician; OR

2. You were referred by a participating physician to a non-participating provider, but you did not sign a written
consent that you knew the services would be out-of-network and would result in costs not covered by your insurer.

A referral occurs: (1) during a visit with your participating physician, a non-participating provider treats you; or (2)
your participating physician takes a specimen from you in the office and sends it to a non-participating laboratory
or pathologist; or (3) for any other health care services when referrals are required under your plan.
___________________________________________________________________________________
I assign my rights to payment to my provider and I certify to the best of my knowledge that:

I (or my dependent) received a surprise bill from a health care provider. I want the provider to seek payment for
this bill from my insurance company (this is an “assignment”). I want my health insurer to pay the provider for
any health care services I or my dependent received that are covered under my health insurance. With my
assignment, the provider cannot seek payment from me, except for any copayment, coinsurance or deductible that
would be owed if I or my dependent used a participating provider. If my insurer paid me for the services, I agree
to send the payment to the provider.

                         Part 1 - Medical Clearance Guest's Letter

Dear Guest,

Virgin Australia is committed to ensuring that your flight with us is as safe and comfortable as possible.


You should be aware that flying can cause complications for guests with certain medical conditions.
Virgin Australia employees are not medically trained and can only provide limited assistance in the
event of a medical emergency. It is for this reason that     Virgin Australia provides Medical Clearance
Guidelines (VAGP-MED-01) to assist guests and their treating doctor to understand some of the risks
associated with air travel.


When making a booking, you must inform Virgin Australia that you have a medical condition. We ask
you to consult your doctor to find out whether it is safe for you to fly. You must provide your doctor with
a copy of the Medical Clearance Guidelines (VAGP-MED-01) including the Medical Clearance Doctor 's
Letter and Medical Clearance Form. These must be completed by your treating doctor on determination
that it is safe for you to travel. Any assessment or appointment with your treating doctor is at your
expense.


It is important that you bring a copy of Part 3 - Medical Clearance Form for each of your intended flights
with Virgin Australia.

Photocopied or fax copies of the form are acceptable provided the information can be clearly read.

In providing this completed form to Virgin Australia you are waiving the confidentiality of this inform ation

disclosed by your doctor. Virgin Australia may disclose the information on this form to any other carrier
associated with your ticket. However, Virgin Australia will not disclose the information on this form to any
other third party without your permission, or unless it is required by law.

Virgin Australia reserves the right to deny boarding if you have not obtained medical clearance or if we
consider that it is not in your best interests to fly.


Please forward the completed forms:

   Effective 04 February 2016


                Part 2 - Guidelines to be referred to by medical practitioner

   These guidelines must be used in conjunction with the Virgin Australia      Medical Clearance Form (Part 3). In

   addition to these guidelines, when considering a passenger      's suitability for air travel, the following must be
   considered:

      –   Reduced atmospheric pressure. Cabin air pressure changes greatly during 15-30 minutes after take-off and
          before landing; gas expansion and contraction can cause pain and pressure effects.
      –   Reduced oxygen tension. Cabin air pressure is equivalent to an altitude of 6000 to 8000 ft and      oxygen

          partial pressure is approximately 20% less than at sea level.
   Use this form to determine if a passenger 's medical condition makes them Unacceptable for Travel or if Medical

   Clearance required before travel. If Medical Clearance is required before travel, the Part  3 - Medical Clearance
   Form must be completed by a medical practitioner (registered doctor).

   NOTE: Any medical condition which would render a passenger unable to complete the flight safely,
            without requiring extraordinary medical assistance during the flight, is considered unacceptable
            for air travel.

   This is not an exhaustive list of conditions. If a person has had recent surgery or suffers from an ailment not
   specified in the table below that may affect their health, they should consult a medical practitioner for travel advice
   and medical clearance.

   Virgin Australia will consider a passenger’s medical condition on a case by case basis however absolute
   contradictions to flying are:

       1.   Within 24 hours of a general anaesthetic
       2.   Uncontrolled bleeding
       3.   Unstable medical or psychiatric conditions

       4.   Uncontrolled Pain
       5.   Known ectopic pregnancy
       6.   Decompression Illness

       7.   Active Tuberculosis or Haemorrhagic Fever

                which will allow them to be changed easily if needed and allow for the order set to
                have accurate evidence.

Keys? Check! Gas tank ﬁlled? Check! Luggage packed? Check! Kids dropped off at my

brother's? Check! My wife and I are ready for a weekend out of town, right? Wrong!

As parents, we have all taken trips, get-away weekends, or simply a night out without
our children. When doing so, we make sure that a sitter or a relative is lined up to watch
the children. However, usually we forget to provide for a situation where the children
might become sick or injured and need medical care.


Anyone who has ever presented a sick or injured child to an emergency room or
neighborhood care center can testify to the fact that care cannot be rendered until a
parent and/or legal guardian has given authorization for the care to be given. In a life-
threatening emergency, care would be rendered. However, in the case of an ear
infection or a cut requiring stitches, the medical provider will require an authorization
before proceeding to treat the child.


At the end of this article, I have drafted a Medical Authorization Form, which has been
printed in a large enough format for use by you. Print it and use it.

This form can be used not only in the situation where you are out of town, but also in an
instance where your child is out of town, such as on a bus trip or traveling with
neighbors. You can also use the form in conjunction with day-care for your children, or
the occasion when a neighbor is watching your children. Lastly, the form also can be

used in the situation where you are watching a neighbor's child.

Please take the time to print and ﬁll out the form. While the form will not do away with
the anxiety of ""what if one of the kids gets sick"", it will alleviate the uncertainty of
whether your child will be able to acquire medical care if you are not present.MEDICAL AUTHORIZATION FORM

I, ___________________________, being the parent and/or legal
guardian of ________________________ (hereinafter, my child(ren)

do hereby authorize _____________________________ to seek and
obtain medical care for my child(ren) in the event that my child(ren)

My child has the following allergies: __________________________.(if applicable)


I agree to be ﬁnancially responsible for the cost of any medical care
provided to my child(ren) under this Authorization.

 Section 5 – Payment details

     •    If you are not personally seeking reimbursement we will pay the treatment provider directly, as long as the payment instructions are
          shown clearly on the invoice.

     •    If you are personally seeking reimbursement, we will only issue payment to:
          •   the patient if they are 18 or over;

          •   the plan holder if the patient is under 18 and is a dependant under the plan; or
          •   the parent or legal guardian named as the primary member, if the patient is under 18.

     •    Ensure that you are able to receive payment in the method and currency you have requested.

     •    We reserve the right to pass on any payment charges incurred by us for cancelling the original payment due to inaccurate
          information submitted to us.
     •    We will not be responsible for any payment shortfall due to exchange rate fluctuations and/or recipient bank service charges. Please

          contact your bank for further details.
     •    If you do not give us the sort code/routing code, BIC/ SWIFT code and/or IBAN number, you may incur additional bank charges and it
          will result in a delay in us paying your claim. You can find the payment information on your bank statement.

     •    Payment by foreign draft / cheque in certain currencies can result in long delays. These delays are beyond our control. We will not
          pay any bank charges incurred in encashing a foreigndraft / cheque. We strongly recommend that, wherever possible, you choose to
          be reimbursed by bank transfer as this is the quickest and safest method of payment.

     •    We can make payment in most readily traded currencies and to most countries. In the event that we are unable to make payment in
          the currency or to the country you have specified, we will contact you to confirm an alternative currency. If you do not specify a
          payment currency, we will pay your claim in the base currency of your plan. For the current list of applicable currencies and countries
          please refer to our website.

     •    We cannot issue non-QAR foreign drafts/cheques to members/providers with bank accounts based in Qatar as the banks will
          not allow those to be encashed   .

     •    Your bank may ask you to complete additional paperwork before they can release our payment to you. This may delay your receipt of
          the payment and is outside our control.

     •    Whenever coverage provided by any insurance policy is in violation of any US, UN or EU economic or trade sanctions, such
          coverage shall be null and void. For example, Aetna companies cannot pay for health care services provided in a country under
          sanction by the United States unless permitted under a written Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) license. Learnmore on the

medical card.

What section of this form do I have to fill in?
The application form is divided into six Parts, you should fill in all of the parts that apply to
you, and have your Doctor of choice complete Part 6.

How do I qualify for a Medical Card?
If you are aged 70 years or over and your gross income is below €700 a week (for a single

person), or below €1,400 a week (for a couple), you are entitled to a Medical Card.

What do you mean by ‘Gross Income’?
Gross income is any income you receive, e.g.: Pensions (social welfare, occupational or
private), Employment – fulltime/part time, self employment, directorship, Investments or
savings, Rental income on properties. In essence, gross income is income before tax or
other deductions.


In regard to rental income, this is the rent received, less necessary expenditure associated
with the rental of a property.

evidence of the information you provide to us:

   PPS Number (e.g. P60, P45, payslip, copy of social welfare book )
   Total Household Income (e.g. Payslip, social welfare book, notice of assessment)

   If you are claiming under E.U. regulations, please enclose the relevant E Form for the
    other European State.What about someone who is under 70 now and married to someone over 70?
If one member of a couple is aged 70 or over, they will both qualify for a Medical Card if
their combined income does not exceed €1,400 a week. The Medical Card will cover the
dependants of a person aged 70 and over, i.e. spouse (U/70 or O/70) and child depend-
ants.


What if my income is above the income limits?
If your income is in excess of the single €700 gross income limits or the couple €1,400
gross income limits, you are not entitled to an over 70 Medical Card. However, if you have
high medical expenses, you can have your income and outgoings assessed under the gen-
eral Medical Card scheme, where all your circumstances will be considered in order to de-
termine if you have entitlement to a Medical Card or GP Visit Card.


If you know that your gross income is above the income limits and you wish to apply for a
general Medical Card if your health circumstances cause you undue financial hardship, you
should fill out a full application form (Form MC1).

210___WG06_Medical_Form.pdf,"       Philmont Medical Form and Requirements


In 2011 Philmont began using the BSA Annual Health and Medical Record, which is now only
very seriously. In particular, note that crew members MUST satisfy physical requirements,ry
without exception - individuals not satisfying requirements WILL be sent home.

All Philmont treks are physically challenging adventures and a rigorous conditioning program is
absolutely important. Each crew member must be in excellent physical condition. Body weight
and blood pressure must be under control and well within the recommended ranges (not just
below the limits).

Advisors must know the health and medical status of each member of the crew before
embarking on any rigorous training such as day hikes, COPE, camping, and backpacking. Parts A
and B of the BSA Annual Health and Medical Record are to be completed by the participant
and family. Copies of those two parts and a prior physical (summer camp, sports, etc.) will give
you that health status information until Part C (the physical exam) is completed. . The form
includes a series of participation advisories that each crew member and his doctor should
review.

               ------------------------------------------------------------

Tip: Now is NOT the time for the youth members of your crew to select their youth leaders
or designate crew responsibiWe will have many helpful suggestions concerning crew
leadership selection and crew member responsibilities in future Watchu Grams.

               ------------------------------------------------------------
Have a Question? You probably will find the answer on the Frequently Asked Questions
(FAQs) page of the Watchu Experience Web site (www.watchu.org). If you don't succeed, try
the super search engine on the Search page or check the Site Map for appropriate areas of
interest. If all else fails, e-mail your questions to Chief Watchu at chiefwatchu@watchu.org.

               ------------------------------------------------------------

Phil Fact: Jacob Fowler (1765-1850) was an early trapper and trader in the area that is now
Philmont who kept a detailed journal of his adventures.

     Parent’s Permission & Acknowledgement of Risk for Son or Daughter to Participate in Athletics
    As the parent or legal guardian of the above named student-athlete, I give my permission for his/her participation in athletic events and the
    physical evaluation for that participation. I understand that this is simply a screening evaluation and not a substitute for regular health care. I also

    grant permission for treatment deemed necessary for a condition arising during participation of these events, including medical or surgical
    treatment that is recommended by a medical doctor. I grant permission to nurses, trainers and coaches as well as physicians or those under their
    direction who are part of athletic injury prevention and treatment, to have access to necessary medical information. I know that the risk of injury to
    my child/ward comes with participation in sports and during travel to and from play and practice. I have had the opportunity to understand the risk

    of injury during participation in sports through meetings, written information or by some other means. My signature indicates that to the best of my
    knowledge, my answers to the above questions are complete and correct. I understand that the data acquired during these evaluations may be
    used for research purposes.

I am the parent (guardian) of the Athlete named in this application. I have read and fully understand the provisions of the Athlete Release Form
(below), and have explained these provisions to the Athlete. Through my signature on this release form, I am agreeing to the above provisions on my

                                             ATHLETE RELEASE FORM


I represent and warrant that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, I am physically and mentally able to participate in Special Olympics activities. I
also represent that a licensed medical professional has reviewed the health information contained in my application and has certified, based on an
independent medical examination, that there is no medical evidence that would preclude me from participating in Special Olympics. I understand that
if I have Down Syndrome, I cannot participate in sports or events which, by their nature, result in hyper-extension, radical flexion or direct pressure
on my neck or upper spine unless I and two physicians have completed the official “Special Release for Athletes with Atlanto-Axial Instability,”
available from the Special Olympics Program in my jurisdiction, or I have had a full radiological examination that establishes the absence of Atlanto-
axial Instability (see box on page 1). I am aware that if I choose not to complete the “Special Release for Athletes with Atlanto-Axial Instability”
form, which establishes the absence of Atlanto-axial Instability, I must have the radiological examination before I can participate in equestrian sports,
gymnastics, pentathlon, butterfly stroke, diving starts in swimming, high jump, alpine skiing, and football (soccer).

Special Olympics has my permission forever to use my likeness, name, voice or words in either television, radio, film, newspapers, magazines, and
other media, and in any form, for the purpose of publicizing, promoting or communicating the purposes and activities of Special Olympics and/or
applying for funds to support these purposes and activities.

I understand that by signing below I consent to participate in the Special Olympics Healthy Athletes Program, which provides individual screening
assessments of health status and health care needs in the areas of: vision; oral health; hearing; physical therapy; and a variety of health promotion
areas (height, weight, sun protection, etc.). I understand that information gathered as part of the Healthy Athletes Program screening process may be
used in group form (anonymously) to assess and communicate the overall health needs of athletes and to develop programs to address those needs. I

understand there is no obligation for me to participate in the Healthy Athletes Program and that I may decide not to participate. Provision of these
health services is not intended as a substitute for regular care. I also understand that I should seek my own independent medical advice and assistance
irrespective of the provisions of these services and that Special Olympics is not through the provision of these provisions responsible for my health.

I acknowledge that Special Olympics events may involve overnight activities and that the housing arrangements for each event may differ. I
understand that I should contact the Special Olympics Program in my jurisdiction if I have any questions about housing arrangements for a specific
event or the housing policy in general.

If, during my participation in Special Olympics activities, I should need emergency medical treatment, and I am not able to give my consent or make
my own arrangements for that treatment for any reason, I authorize Special Olympics to take whatever measures it deems necessary to protect my
health and well-being, including, if necessary, hospitalization. (IF YOU HAVE RELIGIOUS OBJECTIONS TO RECEIVING SUCH
MEDICAL TREATMENT, PLEASE CROSS OUT THIS PARAGRAPH, INITIAL IT AND SIGN AND ATTACH THE SPECIAL
PROVISIONS REGARDING MEDICAL TREATMENT FORM)

                           Instructions for completing a Medical Request form

Use a Medical Request form if you want to resolve a dispute about a workers' compensation medical issue. Do
not use a Medical Request form if you have a dispute about rehabilitation, wage loss or permanent partial

claim (denial of primary liability). You must use an Employee's Claim Petition form in this case.

Item 3 on the front of the Medical Request form lists the most common medical issues in dispute. Here are
some guidelines to help you put your dispute in a category.

a. I request that the insurer pay medical or chiropractic bills. An injured worker may request the insurer

    pay medical or chiropractic bills if the insurer has accepted liability for the claim, but is denying payment for
    any reason. A health care provider may file a request on this issue if there is a dispute about the
    reasonableness and necessity of their services or about the amount billed. A health care provider should
    not submit this form if the issue is whether the work injury was responsible for the workers' need for
    treatment. Do not submit this form unless the insurer has had 30 days to review the bills or has already
    refused to pay.


b. I request a change of treating doctor. The injured worker or the employer/insurer may request a change
    of doctor. Make sure to fill in the name of the current treating doctor and the name of the doctor whom you
    want as the primary health care provider. If the employee and insurer agree on a change of doctor, you do
    not need to file this form.


c. I request that prescribed treatment, surgery or equipment be provided. Check this issue if your doctor
    has prescribed treatment, surgery or equipment but the insurer has not agreed to pay for it. Enclose a copy
    of a doctor's report stating why you need the treatment, surgery or equipment. If a prescription expense is
    disputed, include a copy of the prescription. Examples: approval of rotator cuff surgery as recommended
    by Dr. Jones; three weeks of physical therapy twice a week as prescribed by Dr. Smith; purchase of an
    exercise bicycle as recommended by Dr. Anderson.


d. I request that the insurer reimburse my medical expenses. An injured worker may request expenses
    incurred in receiving medical care be reimbursed. This includes parking and mileage for medical
    appointments and any medication for which the injured worker paid. You should check this issue if you
    have submitted these expenses to your insurer and the insurer has not paid for them. Allow the insurer 30
    days to consider the expenses before submitting a request.


e. I request a second opinion or consultation with ____________________. An injured worker may
    request to see another doctor or other health care provider for another opinion or for a consultation. This
    can either be as a referral from the primary health care provider or a request the injured worker makes on
    his or her own. This is usually done when the treating doctor recommends surgery and you are not sure
    you want to have the surgery and would like another opinion; you may also ask for a second medical

    opinion/consultation for other medical issues as well.

f.  Other. Check this item if you have a medical dispute that does not fit under the other categories. Briefly
    explain what you want.







Instructions for MN MQ03 (4/12)Item 4. If the department orders the insurer to pay for disputed bills or other costs requested on this form, the
insurer also has to reimburse any party who has paid some or all of these costs. The most common example of

this is when an injured employee's private health insurance pays for treatment that should have been paid for
by the workers' compensation insurer. Therefore, it is important that you complete question 4 so the
department knows if there is anyone besides you whom the workers' compensation insurer should reimburse.

Item 5. In item 5, you need to explain the basis for your request. At times, the department may issue a legally
binding written decision based on the information you submit on a Medical Request form and from the
opposing party’s information on the Medical Response form. So it is important that you make your request as

complete as possible.

You must attach documents that support your medical request. If you do not provide documentation
that supports your request, the department may notify you that your Medical Request form is
incomplete and that no further action will be taken on the request until supporting documentation is
submitted.


1. If you are requesting payment of medical or chiropractic bills under item 3(a) or reimbursement of medical
    expenses such as prescriptions or mileage under item 3 (d), you will need to submit copies of the itemized
    bills, prescriptions or mileage expenses. You will need to submit medical reports, doctor’s office notes or
    other information that supports your position. The standard for compensability is whether the treatment was
    reasonable and necessary for the cure and relief of the work injury. There are “treatment parameter” rules
    (in Minnesota Rules, parts 5221.6010 to 5221.6600) that describe what diagnostic procedures, treatments
    and surgeries are considered reasonable and necessary to cure or relieve certain workers’ compensation

    injuries. The treatment parameters also include exceptions to the parameters, which are called
    “departures.” If you are aware of a treatment parameter or departure that supports your treatment claim,
    you may list it on the Medical Request form. If you have any questions about the treatment parameters you
    may call the Alternative Dispute Resolution unit at the number below. Information about treatment
    parameters is on the Department of Labor and Industry website at www.dli.mn.gov/WC/MedBen5.asp.


2. If you are requesting approval of prescribed treatment, surgery or equipment under item 3(c), you will need
    to submit a report from a health care provider recommending the treatment. The standard for
    compensability is whether the treatment is reasonable and necessary for the cure and relief of the work
    injury. As noted above, you may include on the Medical Request form any treatment parameter that
    supports your request for treatment, surgery or equipment.

3. If you are requsting reimbursement of medical expenses under item 3(d) such as prescriptions or mileage

    expenses, you must submit supporting documentation. An example of supporting documentation for a
    prescription is a copy of the prescription; an example of supporting documentation for reimbursement of
    mileage or travel to obtain medical treatment of your injury is documentation of the mileage or receipts for
    other expenses. In addition, if the employer or insurer has denied the expense was necessary for treatment
    of your work injury, submit documentation that the expense was necessary, such as the examples
    described in number one above.


4. If you are requesting a change of doctor, a consultation with another doctor or a second opinion with
    another doctor, explain your reasons. A rule governing change of doctor can be viewed on the Office of the
    Revisor of Statutes website at www.revisor.mn.gov/rules/?id=5221.0430.

5. In addition to the disputes described above, there can be a separate dispute about whether the need for
    treatment is due to the work injury. An example of supporting documetnation for this could be a report or

    office notes from a doctor addressing this issue. The standard for compensability is whether the work injury
    is a substantial contributing factory to a need for medical treatment.

If you have questions about what information to include, call the Alternative Dispute Resolution unit at
(651) 284-5032 or 1-800-342-5354.Item 6. Send a complete copy of all documents to everyone involved in the dispute and list their names and
addresses under item 6 on the back of the request form. If you have a question about who should be

considered involved, call the Alternative Dispute Resolution unit.

In addition to resolving your dispute through this process, the department can also provide you with trained
mediators who may be able to help you resolve your dispute. The department requires that the parties involved
in the dispute agree to having a mediation. If you are interested in this less formal process, call the Alternative
Dispute Resolution unit for more information.",1.6,"{:Author=>""Workers' Compensation Division, Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry"", :Comments=>"""", :Company=>""DLI"", :CreationDate=>""D:20120417090408-05'00'"", :Creator=>""Acrobat PDFMaker 10.1 for Word"", :Keywords=>"""", :ModDate=>""D:20151008145013-05'00'"", :Producer=>""Adobe PDF Library 10.0"", :SourceModified=>""D:20120411150133"", :Subject=>"""", :Title=>""Form:  Medical request""}","<?xpacket begin=""﻿"" id=""W5M0MpCehiHzreSzNTczkc9d""?>

Dear Doctor:

Your patient                                            has applied for enrollment in a fitness testing
and/or a structured exercise program at their worksite. As a participant in this program, she/he may be

participating in the activities named below. Under the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines,
medical clearance has been requested for the following reasons:

                                                                                                            .


Fitness Testing: The purpose of fitness testing is to assess cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength and
endurance, body composition, and flexibility. The cardiorespiratory test is a submaximal test utilizing a
cycle ergometer, bench stepping, a treadmill walk/run test, or similar test. Muscular strength and

endurance tests require body calisthenics and/or use of exercise equipment such as a bench press. Body
composition analysis is performed via skinfold calipers, bioelectric impedance, and/or tape measurement.
Flexibility testing utilizes active movements as the straight leg raising test and sit and reach test.


Structured Exercise Program: The purpose of an exercise program is to develop and maintain
cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength and endurance, body composition, and flexibility. A structured
exercise program is given to each participant based on needs and interests and physician recommendations.

 All exercise programs include warm-up, exercise at target heart rate, and cool-down (except for muscular
strength and endurance training, in which target heart rate is not a factor). The programs may involve
walking/jogging/running, swimming, cycling, rhythmic aerobic exercise (low-moderate-high impact
classes), calisthenics, and/or strength training. Allprograms are designed to place a gradually increasing

workload on the body in order to improve overall fitness and muscular strength. The rate of progression is
regulated by target heart rate and/or perceived rate of exertion.

All fitness tests and exercise programs are administered by qualified personnel trained in conducting

exercise tests and programs as well as having CPR certification.

To facilitate the review and approval of your patient's application for testing and/or exercise program we

require recent (within 12 months) medical information and your recommendations as requested on the
reverse side of this form. If you have any questions about this process please feel free to call our program
staff at                               .

  DeDescription of Serious Health Condition


An illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:

a) Inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility, including any period of incapacity (for
purposes of this policy, defined to mean inability to work, attend school, or perform other daily regular activities due to the Serious

Health Condition, treatment therefore, or recovery there from), or any subsequent treatment in connection with such inpatient care; or

b) Continuing treatment by a Health Care Provider.

A Serious Health Condition involving continuing treatment by a Health Care Provider includes any one or more of the following:


     A period of incapacity and treatment (i.e., inability to work, attend school, or perform other regular daily activities due to the Serious
     Health Condition, treatment therefore, or recovery therefrom) of more than three consecutive, full calendar days, including any
     subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition, that also involves:
     1.  Treatment two or more times within 30 days of the first day of incapacity, unless extenuating circumstances exist, by a Health
          Care Provider, by a nurse or physician assistant under direct supervision of a Health Care Provider, or by a provider of health
          care services (e.g., physical therapist) under orders of, or on referral by, a Health Care Provider; or
     2.   Treatment by a Health Care Provider on at least one occasion, which results in a regimen of continuing treatment under

          the supervision of the Health Care Provider.

     The treatment referenced in paragraphs (1) and (2) must be in-person visits to a Health Care Provider. The first (or only) in-person
     treatment visit must take place within seven days of the first day of incapacity.


     Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal care.

     Any period of incapacity or treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic Serious Health Condition. A chronic Serious
     Health Condition is one that:
     1.  Requires periodic visits (defined as at least twice a year) for treatment by a Health Care Provider, or by a nurse or
          physician assistant under direct supervision of a Health Care Provider;
     2.   Continues over an extended period of time (including recurring episodes of a single underlying condition); and

     3.   May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.)

     A period of incapacity that is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective. The Eligible
     Employee or Family Member must be under the continuing supervision of, but need not be receiving active treatment by, a Health
     Care Provider. Examples include Alzheimer's, a severe stroke, or the terminal stages of a disease.


     Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments (including any period of recovery therefrom) by a Health Care Provider or by
     a provider of health care services under orders of, or on referral by, a Health Care Provider, either for restorative surgery after an
     accident or other injury or for a condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full
     calendar days in the absence of medical intervention or treatment. Examples include cancer (chemotherapy, radiation, etc.),
     severe arthritis (physical therapy), or kidney disease (dialysis).


For the purposes of this definition, treatment includes, but is not limited to, examinations to determine if a Serious Health Condition
exists and evaluations of the condition. Treatment does not include routine physical examinations, eye examinations, or dental
examinations. A regimen of continuing treatment may include, for example, a course of prescription medication. A regimen of continuing
treatment that includes the taking of over-the-counter medications, such as aspirin or antihistamines, or bed rest, exercise, or other
similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a Health Care Provider, is not, by itself, sufficient to constitute a regimen of
continuing treatment for purposes of FMLA leave.


Examples of conditions that do not meet the definition of a Serious Health Condition and do not qualify for FMLA leave include:
          Conditions for which cosmetic treatments are administered (such as most treatments for acne or plastic surgery), unless
          inpatient hospital care is required or unless complications develop.
          Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common cold, the flu, ear aches, upset stomach, ulcers, headaches other
          than migraine, routine dental or orthodontia problems, etc..


Substance abuse may be a Serious Health Condition if the conditions of this section are met. However, FMLA leave may only be taken
for treatment for substance abuse by a Health Care Provider or by a provider of health care services on referral by a Health Care
Provider. Absence because of the Eligible Employee’s use of the substance, rather than for treatment, does not qualify for FMLA leave.

Absences attributable to incapacity due to pregnancy or a chronic Serious Health Condition may qualify for FMLA leave even though
the Eligible Employee or the Covered Family Member does not receive treatment from a Health Care Provider during the absence, and
even if the absence does not last more than three consecutive, full calendar days. For example, an Eligible Employee with asthma may

be unable to report for work due to the onset of an asthma attack or because the Eligible Employee’s Health Care Provider has advised
the employee to stay home when the pollen count exceeds a certain level. An Eligible Employee who is pregnant may be unable to
report to work because of severe morning sickness.",1.6,"{:Author=>""elukesh"", :Company=>""Purdue University"", :Created=>""D:20100623"", :CreationDate=>""D:20161118131408-05'00'"", :Creator=>""Acrobat PDFMaker 11 for Word"", :LastSaved=>""D:20121021"", :ModDate=>""D:20161129152845-05'00'"", :Producer=>""Adobe PDF Library 11.0"", :SourceModified=>""D:20161118180613"", :Title=>""FMLA Medical Certification Form""}","<?xpacket begin=""﻿"" id=""W5M0MpCehiHzreSzNTczkc9d""?>

  I acknowledge and understand that if I do not pass the standards established, I will be disqualified as an applicant for employment. I
  understand that if I am asked to provide additional medical documentation at the time of the evaluation, my physical cannot be completed
  until the requested documentation is received and evaluated. I understand that my employment cannot commence until my physical is
  completed.

  I understand that if the drug test is positive, the information will be sent to the Medical Review Officer (MRO) for review and

  interpretation. MRO findings will be discussed with Human Resources.
  I understand that my urine will be screened for cotinine, a nicotine metabolite, for the purposes of certifying my tobacco use status, should

  I elect to take LHVN benefits I understand that the results of the cotinine screening will be shared with the Benefits Counselors in Human
  Resources, for the sole purpose of benefits administration.

  I understand I will be tested for communicable diseases, including tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. If the result indicates

  infection, an assessment of my job duties will be made to determine if I can perform the essential functions of my position with or without
  reasonable accommodation.

  I understand that results of my pre-employment physical exam may be shared with my direct supervisor if they affect my work duty
  responsibilities.

  understand that I must return to my personal/primary care physician for this care.

  I also understand that if I have patient contact I will be required to be immunized against influenza unless I request and am
  granted an exemption because of a valid medical reason or bonafide religious reason.
